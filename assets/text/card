Dear Jens,

    I just want to start this off by saying thank you for everything, truly. 
    
    I'm so grateful that I was given the chance to meet and become best friends with you, 
    and I hope I get the opportunity to get to know you even more.

    I know I've said this before, and I definitely will say it again and again but you're amazing. 
    You're kind, funny, intelligent, and spontaneous. You always know how to keep things stimulating, interesting
    and a little crazy, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

    This is getting to sound a bit too formal and serious, and I know you are busy with otherstuff, so
    I'll move this along hahaha.

    In all sincerity, thank you for being born, I wouldn't trade our relationship for anything. 
    Happy 21st Birthday Jens!

Love, Peace, and Chicken Grease,

Yvillia
