            <p>Dear Jens,</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 3em">
                <br>
                I just want to start this off by saying thanks for everything. 
                <br><br>
                I'm so grateful that I was given the chance to meet and become best friends with you, 
                and I am excited to get to know you even more in the future.
                <br><br>
                I know I've said this before, and I definitely will say it again and again, but I think you're amazing. 
                You're a kind, funny, intelligent, and spontaneous person, who I am proud to call my best friend.
                You always know how to keep things stimulating, interesting
                and a little crazy, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
                <br><br>
                Perhaps, this is getting a bit too formal and serious. 
                Anyways, I know you are busy today, so I'll move this along now.
                <br><br>
                I made a present for you (hopefully it's recognizable)! To access it, just click the button below!
                In the process of making it, I found out I cannot draw curly hair to save my life, so I tried to draw
                the little drill your bangs used to make. I'm not an artist, but despite all that, I hope you'll enjoy it. 
                <br><br>
                In all sincerity, I wouldn't trade our relationship for anything. 
                <br><br>
                Happy 21st Birthday Jens!
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Hugs and Kisses,
                <br><br>
                Yvillia
            </p>
